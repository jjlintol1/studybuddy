## 🏦 Introduction 

StudyBuddy.ai is a studying web application which allows users to provide their class notes and, through the power of GPT-3.5, create a study set and new quizzes to practice the material. This was a project which we created for the **GrizzHacks 6** Hackathon, and the project won the **Best Use of Next.js** and **Best Use of AI in Education** awards.

## 🖥️ Tech Stack

- Next.js
- Supabase
- Supabase Auth
- Tailwind CSS
- ShadCN UI
- OpenAI API
- LangChain

## ⚙️ Features

- 📖 **AI-Generated Study Sets:** Users can input their notes and receive GPT-created flash cards to study the material in an organized manner.
- ❓ **AI-Generated Quizzes:** Users can use AI to generate new quiz question sets to continuously practice and master the material. Upon submission, the app will give immediate feedback on quiz results.
- 🖥️ **Study set sharing:** Users can browse study sets generated by other users, reference flashcards and generate quiz questions. 
- 📱 **Fully mobile responsive:** The app is adaptable to many different screen sizes. Users will have a smooth experience on mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop devices.

## 💶 Ways to improve application

This application was built in 24 hours at GrizzHacks. Here are some potential future implementations/improvements to the application:

- **Fix JSON bugs:** Currently, quiz question and study set generation are buggy due to buggy parsing of the JSON outputs from the ChatGPT models. We can improve this by improving JSON parsing and error handling at the LangChain layer.
- **Switch to MongoDB or another database provider:** Our experience with Supabase querying was somewhat flaky. We may switch the database provider to Postgres or MongoDB and use Clerk for authentication.
